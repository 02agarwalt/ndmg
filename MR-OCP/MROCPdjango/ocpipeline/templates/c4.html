  The form below takes in raw structural MRI, diffusion MRI, and diffusion scan parameters to estimate brain graphs. 
  The data requirements of this pipeline can be found on 
  <a href="http://m2g.io/tutorials/basic_usage.html#m2g-complete-pipeline">our product page</a>. The atlas image can
  be selected from a drop-down menu, for which the brain mask and corresponding labels are also defined. You may 
  also select to use no region labels and generate a big graph, where each voxel represents a node in the graph.<br>
