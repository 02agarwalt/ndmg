Several utilities, written in python, to manipulate MR fiber data.

Requirements:
  - Python packages:
    - numpy
    - scipy
  - If you want to handle large files...
    - lots of ram (> 8GB)
    - 64-bit python
   
We have been using the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD 7.0),
from http://www.enthought.com/.

*** printfibers.py
    Simple script to echo a fiber file out as text

*** fibgergraph.py
    Module to represent the graph derived from an MRI studio file

*** gengraph.py
    Script to generate a graph on a single MRI studio file

*** generate.py
    Call gengraph.py on directories of MRI studio files
