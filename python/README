Several utilities, written in python, to manipulate MR fiber data.

Requirements:
  - Python packages:
    - numpy
    - scipy
  - If you want to handle large files...
    - lots of ram (> 8GB)
    - 64-bit python
   
We have been using the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD 7.0),
from http://www.enthought.com/.

*** fiber.py
    Module for reading MRI Studio-format fiber files

*** fibers2matrix.py
    Read a fiber file and generate a sparse adjacency matrix between voxels.

*** printfibers.py
    Simple script to echo a fiber file out as text

*** verifyseed.py
    This script will verify that all of the fiber seed locations have
    been labeled.  This is for sanity checking...
