MRImages to Graphs (m2g)
====================================

m2g is a pipeline which takes as input Diffusion Weighted MRI (DTI) data, and produced structural connectomes (brain graphs) as a result.

For information about our pipeline, how to install it, and how to use it, head over to [our website](m2g.io)!

We are part of the bigger **Johns Hopkins University** Open Connectome project found [here](http://www.ocp.me/).
